## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS

### What I learned

I spent a lot of time trying to make the "read more" button perfectly aligned with the side bar, until I realised that this would be hard to do without making it look weird on some view sizes.

### Continued development

I didn't really use much SASS features in this challenge (I only used the nested styling), so I hope I get to properly use more interesting features in the other challenges.
