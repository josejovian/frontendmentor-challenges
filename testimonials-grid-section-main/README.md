## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS

### What I learned

Mixins, extends are some neat features to simplify CSS stylings. Without it, some stylings definitely would have been repeated a few times.

### Continued development

In the next challenges, I hope to get to use more SASS features, appropriately.
