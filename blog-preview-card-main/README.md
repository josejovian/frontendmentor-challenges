## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties

### What I learned

In this challenge, clamp is a nice way to dynamically control font sizes without having to resort to media queries.

### Continued development

There seem to be more interesting CSS functions that I should look into and possibly use in the future.
