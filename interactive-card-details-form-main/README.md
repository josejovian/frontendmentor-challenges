## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- SASS

### What I learned

I may have spent too much time styling the cards' position. Though I've finished the styling and it does look decent, it somehow felt like I did too much just to position the cards. It was probably the `calc` function, or the very specific px sizes.

### Continued development

I'll focus more on the styling aspect.
