## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- SASS

### What I learned

SASS's feature to quickly implement responsive styling is neat. Some combinations of CSS filters can also be useful, such as, `brightness(0%) and invert(100%)`. This turns the non-transparent parts of an image to full white.

### Continued development

I am mostly confident with the stylings I've made. However, sometimes I wonder if there are better/simpler ways to do them.
